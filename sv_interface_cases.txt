- Interface at top module interface only
  - ports must be exploded  in all modules having interface
- Interface within a module and propagated down
  - interface instance exploded in the parent module
  - all sub-modules must have interface exploded


1. Initial process module generates RTLIL instances without parameters and without interface instances
2. In hierarchy step, every time an interface instance is found, derive interface to get non-parameterized version of interface. Then record this, and explode the interface.
3. When reaching sub-modules of the module containing the interface, explode the interfaces based on the recorded interface in 2.
